AutoSleep
=========

Idea: SIGSTOP processes which are not needed when system runs on battery. SIGCONT processes once they are needed again.

For Chrome: All processes which belongs to tabs in the background can be stopped.

In general, if an app is in the background, it can be stopped.

Stop all services except of whitelist?
